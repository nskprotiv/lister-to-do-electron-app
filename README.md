# <u>Lister todo electron app</u>
A todo app made with Electron. It was made with Electron Fiddle so run it with ***Electron 5***.
That's my first Github repository though! Can I say I can't run normal Electron on my laptop. The command line doesn't work
**properly**. The to-do app is good but I noticed some bugs.
